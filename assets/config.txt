# This file configures the collider used by the program.
# Each line is composed of
# <identifier> <type> <params...>
# There are two special identifiers:
# - epsilon, which sets the maximum distance between the generated mesh and the actual surface, and
# - object, which sets the collider that the program will use.
# A valid configuration must specify both epsilon and object.
#
# There are five supported types:
# sphere <radius>                    -- A sphere centered at the origin with the specified radius
# points <x> <y> <z> <x> <y> <z>...  -- The convex hull of a set of points
# point <x> <y> <z>                  -- A single point. Useful for offsetting a shape.
# add <identifierA> <identifierB>    -- The minkowski sum of two colliders.
# sub <identifierA> <identifierB>    -- The "minkowski difference" ({ X | X = A - B }) of two colliders.
